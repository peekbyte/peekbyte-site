I started software development with C++ and VB6 When I was a university student. Early in the 2000s, DotNet Platform was a more popular technology for creating web-based applications. So I focused on DotNet for many years and it made me experienced. Although .Net has many beneficial features such as rapid development, simple debugging and windows integrations, with the passage of the time I found new opportunities in open source languages such as Python and NodeJS.

For the time being, I have extensive experience in developing, analyzing, designing and architecture of web-based applications on the Net platform, Python and front-end technologies such as AngularJS, Angular, and ReactJS. 

I was in charge of developing many solutions for industries and startups including banking, healthcare, fintech, etc.
